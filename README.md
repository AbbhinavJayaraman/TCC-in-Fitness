# TCC-in-Fitness
This is my second stab at the application of ML on optimizing lifting technique, inspired by my prior efforts on UT ECLAIR's Fitness Tracker Team. 

The approach for this particular endeavor was to use Temporal Cycle Consistency TCC
This repositiory includes the following notebooks I created to achieve my results, as well as our final report.

We made use of a subset of videos from the [Qualcomm Exercise Video Dataset](https://www.qualcomm.com/developer/software/qevd-dataset)
Do keep in mind that the scope of the project in its current status was a bit limited due to time constraints for such a college project, but I hope to make another pass at this approach to optimize and improve it.

# Files
**tcc_paper**: This is the TCC's notebook. I debugged and got it working as far as libraries and dependencies, in May of 2025
**tcc_form**: This is the notebook we used to apply TCC to focus on the form of the exercise repeitions
**tcc_rom**: This is the notebook we used to apply TCC to focus on the range of motion (ROM) of the exercise repeitions
**tcc_tempo**: This is the notebook we used to apply TCC to focus on the lifting tempo (time of the contracting, holding, and lowering of the weight/resistance) of the exercise repeitions. 
The PDF is our final project report.
